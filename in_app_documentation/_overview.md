## Overview

The Lipid Brain Atlas Explorer is a Python Dash web-application developped as part of the **Lipid Brain Atlas project**, led by the [Lipid Cell Biology lab (EPFL)](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/dangelo-lab/) and the [Neurodevelopmental Systems Biology (EPFL)](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/nsbl/). It is thought as a graphical user interface to assist the inspection and the analysis of a large mass-spectrometry dataset of lipids distribution at micrometric resolution across the entire mouse brain.

All of the brain slices aquired have prealably been registered to the [Allen Mouse Brain Common Coordinate Framework v3.0](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867420304025) (CCFv3), allowing for a hierarchically structured annotation of our data. This registration can be used to display lipid signal between two m/z boundaries in a given slice (*lipid selection* page, in the app) and perform analyses comparing neuroanatomical regions, e.g. averaging and comparing lipid abundance in each region and make an enrichment analysis (*region analysis* page, in the app). It is also used to combine the 2D slice acquisitions into a browsable 3d model of lipid expression (*three dimensional analysis* page, in the app). Finally, scRNAseq data can also be compared to lipidomics data, in the *spatial transcriptomics* page.

We hope that this application will be of great help to query the Lipid Brain Atlas to guide your hypotheses and experiments, and more generally to achieve a better understanding of the cellular mechanisms involving lipids that are fundamental for nervous system development and function.
