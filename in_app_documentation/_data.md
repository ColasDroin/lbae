## Data

![](ressources/data_acquisition.png)

The multidimensional atlas of the mouse brain lipidome that you can explore through LBAE has been entirely acquired from MALDI Mass Spectrometry Imaging (MALDI-MSI) experiments. We have collected about 6 million mass spectra, corresponding to 18’000 lipid images of 64 serial sections of two individual adult mouse brains (8 weeks old males BL6). Each pixel captures a region of $5μm$, with a spatial resolution of $25μm$ along a given slice and about $200μm$ across slices. The spectral resolution is of the order of $10^{-5} m/z$.
