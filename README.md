# Lipid Brain Atlas Explorer

## Overview

The Lipid Brain Atlas Explorer is a web-application developped as part of the **Lipid Brain Atlas project**, led by the [Lipid Cell Biology lab (EPFL)](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/dangelo-lab/) and the [Neurodevelopmental Systems Biology (EPFL)](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/nsbl/).  It is thought as a graphical user interface to assist the inspection and the analysis of a large mass-spectrometry dataset of lipids distribution at micrometric resolution across the entire mouse brain. 

All of the brain slices aquired have prealably been registered to the Mouse Brain Common Coordinate Framework v3.0 (CCFv3), allowing for a hierarchically structured annotation of our data. This registration can be used to" perform analyses comparing neuroanatomical regions, e.g. averaging and comparing lipid abundance in each region and make an enrichment analysis (*region analysis* page, in the app). It was also used to combine the 2D slice acquisitions into a browsable 3d model (*three dimensional analysis* page, in the app).

We hope that this application will be of great help to query the Lipid Brain Atlas to guide your hypotheses and experiments, and more generally to achieve a better understanding of the cellular mechanisms involving lipids that are fundamental for nervous system development and function.

## Data

The multidimensional atlas of the mouse brain lipidome that you can explore through LBAE has been entirely acquired from MALDI Mass Spectrometry Imaging (MALDI-MSI) experiments.
