##### Current TODOs #####
# TODO Incorporate new brain 1 and brain 2
# TODO Check that all force_update are set to False
# TODO Do quality control and debug, especially when several users are on the app in parallel (make a dummy app with two users and a mmap file, that one opens, the other closes and reopen it, and the first tries to use it)
# TODO Replace brain homepage with rotating transparent gif of 3D expression
# TODO Update notebooks with up-to-date classes

##### Finalization process #####
# TODO Check that readme and documentations are correct and up to date
# TODO Adress remaining # ! and # ? comments in the code
# TODO Make a docker container for the very final version of the app
# TODO Export a sample version of the app and host on heroku (or fly.io ?)
# TODO Clean all notebooks output before last commit
# TODO Delete TODO file

##### Possibilities #####
# ? Split and comment the layouts?
# ? Build basic technical documentation for the app?
# ? Implement the app as a multipage app when the feature is available on Dash
